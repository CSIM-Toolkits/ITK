# CSIM Toolkit - ITK 

This is a repository for ITK modules develped by the Computing in Signals and Images in Medicine Laboratory (CSIM). Here it is available the C++ source code for each application, where you can download and adapt for your needs. Additionally, if you want purpose an improvement for any of our methods, please fork this repository and send us a pull request.

For more details about ITK, see to [website](https://itk.org/).

## Available Methods 

Each method implemented here are organized in different categories, following the ITK style. 

### Module: Filtering
  * Anisotropic Anomalous Diffusion (AAD)
  * Isotropic Anomalous Diffusion (IAD)
  
### Module: Features
  * Diffusion Entropy Mapping
  * Sample Entropy 2D
  * Logistic Contrast Enhancement
  * Image Quality Metrics
  * Automatic Conductance Image Calculator
  
### Module: Segmentation
  * Generalized Entropy Threshold 
  * Multiple Logistic Classification

# Installation Procedure

A simple code provided in the Example folder could be used as guide for the usage of all the tools provided in this repository. The easiest way is to compile the code using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and following the instructions in the Main.cpp file. 

# Documentation

Some of our methods have been published in the [Insight Journal](http://insight-journal.org/) and it could be useful for documentation. However, not all the methods in this repository have a documentation file and, in case of any help, enter in contact with one of our laboratory members (see Contact section). 

# Citation and References

All methods are under the ITK license. However, if you use any of this methods in your own research, please cite it properly. Details about the correct reference to cite each method are provided in the following list:
